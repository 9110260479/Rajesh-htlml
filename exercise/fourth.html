in my opnion there is one book called<u> The Hobbit</> by <u>J.R.R. Tolkien, Douglas A. Anderson</u>  In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the <i>ends of worms</i> and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
Written for J.R.R. Tolkienâ€™s own children, The Hobbit met with instant <b>critical acclaim</b> when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf,
 Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.
